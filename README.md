This will create a build of the website in the `dist` folder and deploy to surge.

### 5. Add Component/Pattern folder and files to source

`add-component.js` is a simple script that will help you add a generate the folders and file needed to develop a component or pattern. The files generated include sass, handlebars, javascript and json.

```

You will then be asked a few questions:

 - What is the name of the component/pattern?

This information is then used to generate the folders and files in the right location in the project source.
